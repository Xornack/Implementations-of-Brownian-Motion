# Implementations-of-Brownian-Motion
Using starter code for a 2D Brownian motion screen saver, implemented the code to accept a few inputs in tkinter and then made a 3D
version using Panda3D.

The Panda3D model is more complex. It works, but it has some shortcomings. To make the code more clear, as per other examples I've seen,
it probably makes more sense to create a lot of little dependent methods and call them. I think the style is not ideal.
